## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [jQuery](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt that it is necessary to use $(document).ready()to ensure that the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded before executing any JavaScript code. If I try to access an element in the DOM before it has been fully loaded, the code may not work as expected.
